This file describes the attributes defined on the AST, roughly in the
order they would be defined.

* result_reg (defined only for expressions) is the HERA register into
  which the expression's result will be placed.

  Note that result_reg will only be computed once and then stored, so
  calling result_reg() a whole bunch won't actually have much cost.


* HERA_code (defined for all node types) is the HERA machine language
  equivalent of the node (including its children).

  Each time HERA_code() is called, it will traverse the tree.
  It is meant to be called *once*, at the root, and not more.


Examples not actually needed for code generation:
* height --- a synthesized attribute giving the height of a node (length of path from most-distant leaf)
  [we'll play with memoizing the result of compute_height, to improve performance].

* depth --- an inherited attribute giving the depth of a node (length of path from the root)
  [this won't work until we get parent pointers working]
